# Lotus Palam-Pulum-Pilish ü§öüèª‚úãüèª

**Palam-Pulum-Pilish** is a hand game, played between at least three people, in which each player simultaneously extends their hand with the palm facing up or down. Palam-Pulum-Pilish is often used as a fair choosing method between three or more people, similar to coin flipping, drawing straws, or throwing dice in order to settle a dispute or make an unbiased group decision.

## Game Rules
The player may start by clicking on one of the two choices: palm facing up or down at the bottom of the game window. After comparing the player's choice with the computers', one of them scores unless all the three players have made the same choice. The first player to reach 5 points is the winner.
