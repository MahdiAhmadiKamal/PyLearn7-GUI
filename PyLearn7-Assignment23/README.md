# Sudoku ðŸ§©

**Sudoku** is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic Sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9 Ã— 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 Ã— 3 subgrids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.
