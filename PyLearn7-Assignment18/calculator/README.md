## Game Rules
Controlling a paddle-like craft known as the ***Vaus***, the player is tasked with clearing a formation of colorful blocks by deflecting a ball towards it without letting the ball leave the bottom edge of the playfield. After all bricks have been destroyed, the player wins. Each time the ball leaves the edge of the playfield, one score is deducted from the player. If this happens three times, the game is over.
